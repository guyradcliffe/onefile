        <headline>ACGME Core Competencies</headline>
        <content><![CDATA[<p>]]>The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) is a private, non-profit council that evaluates and accredits more than 9,000 residency programs across 135 specialties and subspecialties in the United States. The ACGME establishes educational standards and common program requirements for all training programs, and ACGME accreditation signifies a program's commitment to maintaining quality education for residents and safe care for patients. A program must be ACGME-accredited in order to receive federal graduate medical education (GME) funds.<![CDATA[</p><p>]]>In 2002, the ACGME launched a competency initiative called the Outcome Project. As a result of this project, ACGME identified six ACGME Core Competencies to be used by GME programs to evaluate their residents in training. The six ACGME Core Competencies are: patient care; medical knowledge; practice-based learning and improvement; interpersonal and communication skills; professionalism; and systems-based practice. Each competency is made up of different milestones residents are required to master at key stages of their medical training.<![CDATA[</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>]]>In the course of an inpatient stay in a typical U.S. hospital, a patient may receive care from several different types of health care professionals and support staff. Additional health care professionals may provide behind-the-scenes support that assists with the patient's care. If the patient undergoes surgery or another major procedure, even more health care professionals may become involved in that patient's care. Together, these care providers apply a wide range of specialized knowledge and experience all for one purpose: to provide patients with the very best health care possible.<![CDATA[</p><p>]]>The Health Care Team is an educational resource designed to introduce international medical graduates (IMGs) to this concept of teamwork in the U.S. medical system and to members of the Health Care Team.<![CDATA[</p>]]></content>

        <headline>Verification of Credentials</headline>
        <content>Primary-source verification is a rigorous, multi-step process that ECFMG employs to ensure the integrity and authenticity of a physician's medical education credentials.<![CDATA[</p><p>]]>When ECFMG receives a credential issued by a medical school, it first reviews the credential and compares it to sample primary-source verified documents from its Medical Credentials Reference Library to confirm that it is consistent with the format of credentials issued by the medical school. If the credential is determined to be consistent with verified samples, ECFMG will communicate directly with the issuing institution to request verification of the credential's authenticity. If ECFMG believes it will facilitate the verification process, ECFMG will communicate with an institution in the language of the country in which the institution is located. ECFMG currently verifies documents using 11 languages.<![CDATA[</p>]]></content>
